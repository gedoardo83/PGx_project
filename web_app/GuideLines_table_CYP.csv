Avoid tertiary amine use due to potential for sub-optimal response. Consider alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19.

Trimipramine	CYP2C19	PM	Greatly reduced metabolism of tertiary amines compared to normal metabolizers. Decreased conversion of tertiary amines to secondary amines may affect response or side effects.	Avoid tertiary amine use due to potential for sub-optimal response. Consider alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19.

Venlafaxine	CYP2D6	PM	Clinical effect (S): long-standing discomfort (48-168 hr) without permanent injury e.g. failure of therapy with tricyclic antidepressants, atypical antipsychotic drugs; extrapyramidal side effects; parkinsonism; ADE resulting from increased bioavailability of tricyclic antidepressants, metoprolol, propafenone (central effects e.g. dizziness); INR 4.5-6.0; neutropenia 1.0-1.5x109/l; leucopenia 2.0-3.0x109/l; thrombocytopenia 50-75x109/l.	Insufficient data to allow calculation of dose adjustment. Select alternative drug (e.g., citalopram, sertraline) or adjust dose to clinical response and monitor (O-desmethyl)venlafaxine plasma concentration.	dpwg	yellow	Possibile aumento degli effetti collaterali

Venlafaxine	CYP2D6	UM	Minor clinical effect (S): QTc prolongation (<450 ms female, <470 ms male); INR increase < 4.5. Kinetic effect (S).	Be alert to decreased venlafaxine and increased (O-desmethyl)venlafaxine plasma concentration. Titrate dose to a maximum of 150% of the normal dose or select alternative drug (e.g., citalopram, sertraline).	dpwg	yellow	Possibile riduzione dell'efficacia clinica ed aumento effetto collaterale
