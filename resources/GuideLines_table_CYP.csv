Venlafaxine	CYP2D6	IM	Clinical effect (S): long-standing discomfort (48-168 hr) without permanent injury e.g. failure of therapy with tricyclic antidepressants, atypical antipsychotic drugs; extrapyramidal side effects; parkinsonism; ADE resulting from increased bioavailability of tricyclic antidepressants, metoprolol, propafenone (central effects e.g. dizziness); INR 4.5-6.0; neutropenia 1.0-1.5x109/l; leucopenia 2.0-3.0x109/l; thrombocytopenia 50-75x109/l.	Insufficient data to allow calculation of dose adjustment. Select alternative drug (e.g., citalopram, sertraline) or adjust dose to clinical response and monitor (O-desmethyl)venlafaxine plasma concentration.	dpwg	
Venlafaxine	CYP2D6	UM	Minor clinical effect (S): QTc prolongation (<450 ms female, <470 ms male); INR increase < 4.5. Kinetic effect (S).	Be alert to decreased venlafaxine and increased (O-desmethyl)venlafaxine plasma concentration. Titrate dose to a maximum of 150% of the normal dose or select alternative drug (e.g., citalopram, sertraline).	dpwg
